It's been two years since my last post about the 8088 motherboard. Due to work, I've continued researching and following up but haven't had the time to post. In fact, this board was completed nearly a year ago. I'm now sharing it for everyone to study and draw inspiration from. (Seriously posting for essence)
(Development materials are in the attachments, including schematics, PCB design drawings, BIOS source code, and the floppy drive controller from a foreign open-source project, with the website link attached for those interested. Additionally, the BIOS source code also uses foreign open-source code, which is compatible with IBM's BIOS.)
Drawings, BIOS, manual, etc.

This is a core board compatible with IBM XT machines:

CPU: 8088CPU (NEC V20), 8087 coprocessor; (NEC V20 is also a chip fully compatible with the 8088, but the V20 has lower power consumption and higher performance)
Chipset: FE2010A (introduced separately later) is essentially a collection of IBM PC-compatible peripheral chips like 8284, 8259, 8255, 8288, 8237, etc.
Memory: 512+128=640KB RAM, 64KB BIOS ROM
Speaker: Compatible with IBM PC beeper
Keyboard: Compatible with IBM PC keyboard (XT protocol keyboard interface)
This core board is intended for use in making a laptop computer, which is also in the works. It's been a decade-long project, with each circuit first made as a module and then assembled together later. Today's post features a test base board specifically for this core board, which is just a breakout board converting to standard ISA interface. Without further ado, let's start with the pictures and go from there.

1. Core board: as shown below, with text descriptions.

Due to image size limitations, the next picture is a compressed view of the front and back of the core board.

Compared with a bank card

As shown below: If you compare the core board to an IBM PC, it would look something like this

Then, the FE2010A would roughly be equivalent to this

Next is the test base board made for testing. It has no chips, just breakout lines.

Next up is testing. The test included a floppy drive, hard disk (DISK ON CHIP), graphics card + TFT LCD screen

Starting up:

Due to the limited resolution of the LCD, the display is not complete. Just make do with what we have.

Since no keyboard was plugged in, here it prompts to boot from the floppy drive, (the LCD resolution is insufficient, so the prompt isn't displayed, those interested can try making one themselves for a detailed exploration.)
The graphics card can use a standard ISA graphics card, with basic support for 8-bit CGA, MDA, VGA. It's just that my studio is small. Connecting to a monitor is also a hassle.

Here's an introduction to the FE2010A chip, which actually includes many types. It consolidates IBM PC's peripheral chips like 8284, 8288, 8237, etc., into one. I'll attach the manual later.

FE2010A is not the most commonly used, nor is it the smallest. Some friends abroad have also used this chip to make motherboards, and I used their BIOS. I was happy to see others sharing the same hobby when I was searching for chips, which is why it took me a few months to make this core board. My research initially focused on another chip, but the functionality is essentially the same.

The PCB layout and wiring were all done manually, line by line. Since only a double-sided board was used, space for routing was tight, so vias were made on the pads (manual soldering doesn't affect it at all, and the electrical performance is also perfectly fine). The wiring was revised many times, taking nearly 2 months of spare time.

The information has been updated, and I have many more DIY experiments and works that I couldn't upload all at once. If anyone interested in DIY 8088 projects wants other materials, feel free to contact me. I'll share more once my laptop is completed.
